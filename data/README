Data Explanation

image set 85, 86, 87, 88 each contains 70k pokes(slightly more than 70k), which
collectively constitute 280k pokes

image_8*, image_8*_depth, and image_8*.txt form a set,
  where image folder contains continuous frames, i.e. image_t + poke_t -> image_t+1,
  image depth folder contains corresponding depth image with a scaling of 10000.0
  image.txt documents the specifics of a poke: (each row represents one poke)
    row entry   (world frame coordinates)
